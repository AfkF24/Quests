#
# The Quests data migration tool is a tool that allows you to migrate your data from one storage
# system (referred to as 'storage provider') to another. This file serves as a configuration for
# both storage systems to migrate from.
#
# The 'from' section below is the configuration for the storage provider you are migrating from.
# The 'to' section below is the configuration for the storage provider you are migrating to.
#
# The 'from' and 'to' sections are both required.
#
# When you have configured both storage providers, you must set the 'ready' flag to true.
# The command will not work if this is not done.
#
# WARNING: This process should be done on a server with no players online, from your
#          server console. Unexpected behaviour or potential data corruption may occur
#          if players are online!
#
# One everything is configured, you can execute the migration with the following command:
#     /quests admin migratedata execute
#
# When the process has finished, you can remove this file. You must update your main
# configuration file to point to the new storage provider manually.
